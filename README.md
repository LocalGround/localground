# About
Local Ground is a software platform for online mapping that allows you to create and share your own annotated online maps.  Using this tool, you can draw on existing maps, add pictures, audio, video and other data, and share with your friends, family and colleagues.  This tool is currently being developed by the Represent Research Group at the I School at the University of California, Berkeley.  

# Code Status
Local Ground isn't quite ready yet, and is being actively developed.  Of course you're welcome to take a look at it, but we're still working on implementing all of the core features needed for the beta release and fixing bugs: http://bugzilla.localground.org.  We're currently testing out functionality with some of our core users, and will continue to update this README file as the tool progresses.
