        <h3>Print a Paper Map</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Log in to Local Ground. Request an account if you don't have one already.</li>
            <li>Click on the <a href="http://ellenvanwyk.github.io/maps/edit/new/">Edit Map</a> link
            (top, left-hand side of screen)</li>
            <li>Pan / zoom the map as desired and click the "Print" button.</li>
            <li>Create a new Project if you haven't already.</li>
            <li>Download the PDF. Print as many copies as you need.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            Draw Your Places
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Draw / write on the maps with one or more colored pens.  Make sure not
            to write on the bar code. Everywhere else is fine!</li>
            <li>MapImage your map or take a picture of it. MapImagening works best, but camera
            pictures are OK too. Make sure to include the entire map and barcode.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            Upload Maps, Pictures, &amp; Audio
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Click the <a href="http://ellenvanwyk.github.io/upload/">Upload</a> button / link, and select
                the kind of media you would like to upload.  You may upload:

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>You can either drag your map images onto the gray box or click
                the green button and browse to your map images.</li>
            <li>We will try to detect the kind of media youâ€™ve dragged onto the page, but
            if it's a map of a form, be sure that the "file type" selection is "Map / Form", and then press the
                blue "Start Upload" button.</li>
        </ol>

                    <li>If you want to add additional metadata to your media file, you
                        can click on its icon again and fill out the form.</li>

        <p>Coming Soon!</p>

        <h3>
            Share with Your Friends!
        </h3>
        <p>You can share a link to your map by pressing the "Share" button on the
        <a href="http://ellenvanwyk.github.io/profile/projects/">Projects</a> page.
        The visibility of your maps will depend on the option you select:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If you select Public, Local Ground will provide a simple web address for
                you to host your map, like http://localground.org/maps/YourProject.
                Other people will also be able to search for and see your map from the
                Local Ground home page.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you select Private w/ Link, Local Ground will provide a complicated
                web address like http://localground.org/maps/SecretNumber so that only
                those people you send the address will be able to view the map.
                The map will also not show up on the Local Ground home page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, if you select Private w/ Login, people will need a Local Ground
                login and explicitly be provided access to the map to view it.
            </li>
        </ol>


        <p>We are working on new tools to present and visualize your data. Stay tuned
        for the next release of Local Ground!</p>
