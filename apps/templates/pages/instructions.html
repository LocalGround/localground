    Draw Your Places

    Share with Your Friends!
</h3>
<p>You can share a link to your map by pressing the "Share" button on the
<a href="/profile/projects/">Projects</a> page.
The visibility of your maps will depend on the option you select:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        If you select Public, Local Ground will provide a simple web address for
        you to host your map, like http://localground.org/maps/YourProject.
        Other people will also be able to search for and see your map from the
        Local Ground home page.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you select Private w/ Link, Local Ground will provide a complicated
        web address like http://localground.org/maps/SecretNumber so that only
        those people you send the address will be able to view the map.
        The map will also not show up on the Local Ground home page.
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, if you select Private w/ Login, people will need a Local Ground
        login and explicitly be provided access to the map to view it.
    </li>
</ol>


<p>We are working on new tools to present and visualize your data. Stay tuned
for the next release of Local Ground!</p>
